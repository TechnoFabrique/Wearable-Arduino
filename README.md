# Wearable-Arduino
The purpose of this project is to create a IoT (Internet of Things) device with arduino which send data to ThingSpeak by WiFi, and create real-time graphics.

ThingSpeak store and retrieve data from things using the HTTPprotocol over the Internet.

We are going to create a tiny device (60x90 mm - 2.36x3.54 inches) with the Feather Huzzah card from Adafruit and send data to ThingSpeak using the ESP8266 WiFi device. We are going to send the data from our light sensor made with a photoresistor.

Eventually, the whole device will hold in a tiny box (3D printed + wood) which will make our IoT project fully wearable.
